/* 
    The ShapeDraw applet lets the user add small colored shapes to
    a drawing area and then drag them around.  The shapes are rectangles,
    ovals, and roundrects.  The user adds a shape to the canvas by
    clicking on a button.  The shape is added at the upper left corner
    of the canvas.  The color of the shape is given by the current
    setting of a pop-up menu.  The user can drag the shapes with the
    mouse.  Ordinarily, the shapes maintain a given back-to-front order.
    However, if the user shift-clicks on a shape, that shape will be
    brought to the front.
    
    This file defines the applet class plus several other classes used
    by the applet, namely:  ShapeCanvas, Shape, RectShape, OvalShape,
    and RoundRectShape.  These classes are nested inside the main class,
    so the compiled class files for these classes will have named like
    ShapeDraw$ShapeCanvas.class.  All the class files are necessary to
    run the applet.
    
    This applet requires Java version 1.2 or higher.
