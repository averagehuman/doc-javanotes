<p>

<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains links</span> to the source code for

examples appearing in the free, on-line textbook <i><a href="../index.html">Introduction 
to Programming Using Java,</a></i> Sixth Edition. 
You should be able to compile the files and use them. Note however that some of these
examples depend on other source files, such as <span class="sourceref"><a href="TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span> 
and <span class="sourceref"><a href="MosaicPanel.java">MosaicPanel.java</a></span>,
that are not built into Java. These are classes that I have written. <b>Links to
all necessary non-standard source code files are provided below.</b>  To compile
a program that uses a non-standard class, the source code file or the compiled class
file for that class should be in the same location as the program that uses it.
To run the program, you only need the compiled class file.
Note that almost all of my classes are meant to be placed in the default package,
to be used by programs that are also in the default package.  To use them
in other packages, you will have to add an appropriate "package" declaration to the
beginning of the source code.</p>


<p>The solutions to end-of-chapter exercises are <b>not</b>
listed on this page. Each end-of-chapter 
exercise has its own Web page, which
discusses its solution. The source code of a sample solution of each exercise
is given in full on the solution page for that exercise. If you want to compile
the solution, you should be able to cut-and-paste the solution out of a Web
browser window and into a text editing program. (You can't cut-and-paste from
the HTML source of the solution page, since it contains extra HTML markup
commands that the Java compiler won't understand; the HTML markup does
not appear when the page is displayed in a Web browser.)</p>


<p>Note that most of these examples require Java version 5.0 or later. A few of
them were written for older versions, but will still work with current
versions. When you compile some of these older programs with current versions
of Java, you might get warnings about "deprecated" methods. These warnings are
<b>not</b> errors. When a method is deprecated, it means that it should not be used in
new code, but it has not yet been removed from the language. It is possible
that deprecated methods might be removed from the language at some future time,
but for now you just get a warning about using them.</p>

<a name="source.1">Part 1: Text-oriented Examples</a>
</h3>


<p>Many of the sample programs in the text are based on console-style
input/output, where the computer and the user type lines of text back and forth
to each other. Some of these programs use the standard output object,
<span class="code">System.out</span>, for output. Many of them use my non-standard class,
<span class="classname">TextIO</span>, for both input and output. For the programs that use <span class="classname">TextIO</span>,
one of the files <span class="sourceref"><a href="TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span> or TextIO.class must
be available when you compile the program, and TextIO.class must be available
when you run the program.  There is also a GUI version of TextIO;
you can find information about it at the end of this web page.</p>


<p>The programs listed here are stand-alone
applications, not applets, but I have written applets that simulate many of the
programs.  These "console applets" appear on Web pages in the on-line version
of this textbook.  They
are based on <span class="sourceref"><a href="TextIOApplet.java">TextIOApplet.java</a></span>, which provides
the same methods as <span class="classname">TextIO</span>, but in an applet instead of in
a stand-alone application.  It is straightforward to convert a
TextIO program to a TextIOApplet applet.  See the comments in the
<span class="sourceref"><a href="TextIOApplet.java">TextIOApplet.java</a></span> file for information about
how to do it.  One example of this can be found in the file
<span class="sourceref"><a href="Interest3Console.java">Interest3Console.java</a></span>.</p>

<a name="source.4">Part 4: Auxiliary Files</a>
</h3>


<p>This section lists some of the extra source files that are required by
various examples in the previous sections. The files listed here
are those which are general enough to be potentially useful in
other programming projects. Links to these files are also given above,
along with the programs that use them.</p>


<ul>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span> defines a class containing some
   static methods for doing input/output. These methods make it easier to use the
   standard input and output streams, <span class="code">System.in</span> and <span class="code">System.out</span>.
   <span class="classname">TextIO</span> also supports other input sources and output destinations,
   such as files.  Note that this version of <span class="classname">TextIO</span> requires Java 5.0 (or higher).  The
   <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class defined by this file is only useful in a command-line
   environment, and it might be inconvenient to use in integrated development environments such
   as Eclipse in which standard input does not work particularly well. In that case, you might want to use
   the following file instead.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="TextIO-GUI/TextIO.java">TextIO.java for GUI</a></span> defines an
   alternative to the preceding file. It defines a version of <span class="classname">TextIO</span> with the same set of
   input and output routines as the original version. But
   instead of using standard I/O, this GUI version opens its own window, and the
   input/output is done in that window.  Please read the comments at the beginning
   of the file. (For people who have downloaded this book: The file is located in
   a directory named TextIO-GUI inside the source directory.)</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="TextIOApplet.java">TextIOApplet.java</a></span> can be used for writing applets that simulate
   <span class="classname">TextIO</span> programs.  This makes it possible to write applets that use
   "console-style" input/output.  Such applets are created as subclasses of <span class="classname">TextIOApplet</span>.
   See the comments in the file for more information about how to convert a TextIO
   program into a TextIOApplet applet.  An example can be found in the file
   <span class="sourceref"><a href="Interest3Console.java">Interest3Console.java</a></span>.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="AnimationBase.java">AnimationBase.java</a></span>, a
   class that can be used as a framework for writing animated applets. To use the
   framework, you have to define a subclass of <span class="classname">AnimationBase</span>.
   <a href="../c3/s8.html">Section&nbsp;3.8</a> has an example.</li> 
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="Mosaic.java">Mosaic.java</a></span> contains subroutines for opening and controlling a
   window that contains a grid of colored rectangles.  It depends on <span class="sourceref"><a href="MosaicCanvas.java">MosaicCanvas.java</a></span>.
   This is a toolbox for writing simple stand-alone applications that use a "mosaic window."  This
   is rather old code, but it is used in examples in <a href="../c4/s6.html">Section&nbsp;4.6</a>
   and <a href="../c4/s7.html">Section&nbsp;4.7</a>.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="MosaicPanel.java">MosaicPanel.java</a></span> is a greatly improved version of <span class="sourceref"><a href="MosaicCanvas.java">MosaicCanvas.java</a></span>
   that has many options.  This class defines a subclass of JPanel that shows little
   rectangles arranged in rows and columns.  It is used in the "mosaic draw" example in
   <a href="../c6/s8.html">Section&nbsp;6.8</a>.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="Expr.java">Expr.java</a></span> defines a class <span class="classname">Expr</span> that
   represent mathematical expressions involving the variable <span class="code">x</span>.  It is used
   in some of the exercises in <a href="../c8/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;8</a>.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="netgame/common/">netgame.common</a></span> is a package that defines a 
   framework for networked games,
   which is discussed in detail in <a href="../c12/s5.html">Section&nbsp;12.5</a>.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="netgame/fivecarddraw/PokerRank.java">PokerRank.java</a></span> can be
   used to assign ranks to hands of cards in poker games.  The cards are defined
   in the class <span class="sourceref"><a href="netgame/fivecarddraw/PokerCard.java">PokerCard.java</a></span>.
   Both of these classes are part of the package <span class="sourceref"><a href="netgame/fivecarddraw/">netgame.fivecarddraw</a></span>,
   which is discussed in <a href="../c12/s5.html#threads.5.4">Subsection&nbsp;12.5.4</a>.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="edu/hws/eck/mdb/I18n.java">I18n.java</a></span> is a class that
   can be used to help in internationalization of a program.  See
   <a href="../c13/s5.html#GUI2.5.3">Subsection&nbsp;13.5.3</a>.</li>
