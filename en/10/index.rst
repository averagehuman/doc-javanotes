Generic Programming and Collection Classes
------------------------------------------



H ow to avoid reinventing the wheel? Many data structures and
algorithms, such as those from `Chapter9`_, have been studied,
programmed, and re-programmed by generations of computer science
students. This is a valuable learning experience. Unfortunately, they
have also been programmed and re-programmed by generations of working
computer professionals, taking up time that could be devoted to new,
more creative work. A programmer who needs a list or a binary tree
shouldn't have to re-code these data structures from scratch. They are
well-understood and have been programmed thousands of times before.
The problem is how to make pre-written, robust data structures
available to programmers. In this chapter, we'll look at Java's
attempt to address this problem.
