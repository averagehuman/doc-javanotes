-----------------------------------------------------

:Author: `David J. Eck <mailto:eck@hws.edu>`_


WELCOME TO the Sixth Edition of Introduction to Programming Using
Java , a free, on-line textbook on introductory programming, which
uses Java as the language of instruction. This book is directed mainly
towards beginning programmers, although it might also be useful for
experienced programmers who want to learn something about Java. It is
certainly not meant to provide complete coverage of the Java language.

The sixth edition requires Java 5.0 and can also be used with later
versions of java. Almost all the examples in the book will work with
Java 5.0, but some features from later versions of Java are also
covered. You will find many Java applets on the web pages that make up
this book, and most of those applets require Java5.0 or higher to
function. Earlier editions of the book are still available; see the
:doc:`preface` for links.

You can **download** Introduction to Programming Using Java for use on
your own computer. A PDF version is also available. Links can be found
at the bottom of this page.

**Search this Text:** Although this book does not have a conventional
index, you can search it for terms that interest you. Note that this
feature searches the book at its on-line site, so you must be working
on-line to use it.

  This "bzip2 tar" archive contains a complete copy of the web site in a
  format that allows greater compression but that might not be usable on
  all computers. On most UNIX systems, including Linux and Mac OS, you
  should be able to extract it using the command

  command line (if it is not extracted automatically when you download
  it). (Size:3.2Megabytes.)

  parts as `http://www.lulu.com/content/559884`_ and
