Introduction to Programming Using Java, Sixth Edition
-----------------------------------------------------


:Version: Version 6.0, June 2011
:Author: `David J. Eck<mailto:eck@hws.edu>`_


WELCOME TO the Sixth Edition of Introduction to Programming Using
Java , a free, on-line textbook on introductory programming, which
uses Java as the language of instruction. This book is directed mainly
towards beginning programmers, although it might also be useful for
experienced programmers who want to learn something about Java. It is
certainly not meant to provide complete coverage of the Java language.

The sixth edition requires Java 5.0 and can also be used with later
versions of java. Almost all the examples in the book will work with
Java 5.0, but some features from later versions of Java are also
covered. You will find many Java applets on the web pages that make up
this book, and most of those applets require Java5.0 or higher to
function. Earlier editions of the book are still available; see the
:doc:`preface` for links.

You can **download** Introduction to Programming Using Java for use on
your own computer. A PDF version is also available. Links can be found
at the bottom of this page.

**Search this Text:** Although this book does not have a conventional
index, you can search it for terms that interest you. Note that this
feature searches the book at its on-line site, so you must be working
on-line to use it.

Downloading And Other Links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


+ **`http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/downloads/javanotes6.zip`_** --
  This "zip" archive contains a complete copy of the web site. It should
  be usable on almost any computer. (Size:4.4Megabytes.)
+ **`http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/downloads/javanotes6.tar.bz2`_** --
  This "bzip2 tar" archive contains a complete copy of the web site in a
  format that allows greater compression but that might not be usable on
  all computers. On most UNIX systems, including Linux and Mac OS, you
  should be able to extract it using the command
  "bunzip2javanotes6.tar.bz2" followed by "tarxfjavanotes6.tar" on the
  command line (if it is not extracted automatically when you download
  it). (Size:3.2Megabytes.)
+ **`http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/downloads/javanotes6-linked.pdf`_**
  -- a PDF version with internal links for navigation and external links
  to source code files, exercise solutions, and other resources that are
  not included in the PDF. (Size:6Megabytes; 751 pages.)
+ **`http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/downloads/javanotes6.pdf`_** -- a
  PDF version without links, more suitable for printing.
  (Size:5.5Megabytes; 758 pages.)
+ **Printed versions** -- I have made this book available for purchase
  in printed versions from the print-on-demand publisher `lulu.com`_.
  This is for convenience only, for those who would like to have a bound
  printout in a nice form. (Please **do not** feel obliged to buy the
  printed version; I do not make any money from it!) The entire book is
  available in a rather thick printed version at
  `http://www.lulu.com/content/612392`_. It is also available in two
  parts as `http://www.lulu.com/content/559884`_ and
  `http://www.lulu.com/content/822314`_.
+ **Complete Sources** -- The complete source files that are used to
  produce both the web site and PDF versions of this book are available
  for download, but will be useful only to a very limited audience. See
  the end of the :doc:`preface` for more information and a link.
