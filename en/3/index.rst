Programming in the Small II: Control
------------------------------------



T he basic building blocks of programs -- variables, expressions,
assignment statements, and subroutine call statements -- were covered
in the previous chapter. Starting with this chapter, we look at how
these building blocks can be put together to build complex programs
with more interesting behavior.

Since we are still working on the level of "programming in the small"
in this chapter, we are interested in the kind of complexity that can
occur within a single subroutine. On this level, complexity is
provided by control structures. The two types of control structures,
loops and branches, can be used to repeat a sequence of statements
over and over or to choose among two or more possible courses of
action. Java includes several control structures of each type, and we
will look at each of them in some detail.

This chapter will also begin the study of program design. Given a
problem, how can you come up with a program to solve that problem?
We'll look at a partial answer to this question in `Section3.2`_.
