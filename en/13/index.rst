13. Advanced GUI Programming
----------------------------


It's possible to program a wide variety of GUI applications using
only the techniques covered in `Chapter6`_. In many cases, the basic
events, components, layouts, and graphics routines covered in that
chapter suffice. But the Swing graphical user interface library is far
richer than what we have seen so far, and it can be used to build
highly sophisticated applications. This chapter is a further
introduction to Swing and other aspects of GUI programming. Although
the title of the chapter is "Advanced GUI Programming," it is still
just an introduction. Full coverage of this topic would require at
least another complete book.
